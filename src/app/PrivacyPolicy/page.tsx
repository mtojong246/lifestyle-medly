                <p className='mb-5'>The Website and Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser, tell us how and when you visit and use our Website and Services, analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Website and Services. Cookies are small pieces of data – usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to access our Website and Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your devices. Because of our use of Cookies, the Website and Services do not support “Do Not Track” requests sent from a browser at this time.</p>
                <p className='mb-5'>We use the following types of Cookies:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-10">
                    <li><p className='mb-5'>Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Website and Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.</p></li>
                    <li><p className='mb-5'>Functional Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Website and Services, maintain your preferences over time, and recognize you when you return to our Website and Services. These Cookies help us personalize our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</p></li>
                    <li><p className='mb-5'>Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Website and Services. They do this by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Website and Services, what pages visitors view on our Website and Services, and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Website and Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns to help us improve our campaigns and the Website and Services’ content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google LLC (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Website and Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

                <p className='mb-5'>You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies through the “CookieBot” that appears each time you access the Website, or your internet browser’s settings, most of which have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, and which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well.</p>

                <p className='mb-5 font-semibold underline'>Information about Interest-Based Advertisements:</p>
                <p className='mb-5'>We may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors, and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Website and Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Website and Services and/or services of third parties. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Website and Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Website and Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>

                <p className='mb-5 font-semibold underline'>Social Media</p>
                <p className='mb-5'>Lifestyle Medly may provide the option for individuals to participate in polling, messaging, and posting activities, including through social media channels. Lifestyle Medly is not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM, or any other social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Data you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with our social media pages. Additionally, Lifestyle Medly may monitor social media channels for mentions of our brand, competitors, and products, which gives Lifestyle Medly an opportunity to track, analyze, and respond to conversations about us on social media.</p>

                <p className='mb-5 font-semibold underline'>Third Party Sites</p>
                <p className='mb-5'>The Lifestyle Medly Website and Services may feature links to third-party websites ("Third-Party Site(s)"). These Third-Party Sites are not owned or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such Third-Party Sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Lifestyle Medly Website. If you choose to link to a Third-Party Site, you should read the privacy policy, statement, or policy of that website to understand how that Third-Party Site collects and uses Personal Data. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information collected by Third-Party Sites.</p>



                <p className='mb-5 font-semibold underline'>How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?</p>
                <p className='mb-5'>We intend to keep your Personal Data and Information accurate and up-to-date and retain it for the period necessary to fulfill the legitimate business purposes or uses outlined in this Privacy Policy (i.e., as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services), unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by applicable data protection law or regulation or to otherwise fulfill a legal obligation. In addition, Information about you may be retained for a longer period of time to resolve disputes or collect fees owed to us, or as otherwise advisable, permitted, or required by applicable law, rule, or regulation. Precisely how long we need to keep your Personal Data and Information depends on the purpose for which we collect it, and therefore there is no standard retention period. Thus, the retention period may vary depending on the circumstances. For other legal reasons, e.g., in the context of legal claims, we may need to hold Personal Data and Information beyond the term required to meet the defined purpose for which they were collected in the first place. However, in these cases, we will no longer actively process the Personal Data for the originally specified purpose. We also retain Information in an anonymous, deidentified form which would not identify you personally for archival and research purposes. In general, we do not retain the Information collected on the Lifestyle Medly website for longer than five (5) years unless we have a need to retain it for legal or regulatory purposes.</p>

                <p className='mb-5 font-semibold underline'>How Do We Protect Your Personal Data?</p>
                <p className='mb-5'>Lifestyle Medly maintains a comprehensive data security program, including commercially reasonable administrative, physical, and technological security measures, to protect your Personal Data and Information and to guard against unauthorized access to your Personal Data and Information or against the unauthorized alteration, disclosure, destruction, and/or loss of such data. In deciding what level of security is appropriate, Lifestyle Medly will take into account the nature of the Personal Data and Information in question and the harm that might result from its unauthorized use, disclosure, or loss.</p>
                <p className='mb-5'>Although we take reasonable precautions to protect the Information and Personal Data we collect on the Lifestyle Medly Website and Services and store in our databases, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
