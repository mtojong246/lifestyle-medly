                <p className='mb-5'>Protected Health Information (“PHI”) is any information that identifies you or may be used to identify you (e.g., basic demographic information); that is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer or health care clearinghouse; and that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition and related health care services, or provision of or payment for health care. This protection extends to any PHI whether in oral, written, or electronic format. This Notice of Health Information Privacy Practices (“Notice”) describes how we may use and disclose your PHI to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations and for other specified purposes that are permitted or required by law. </p>
